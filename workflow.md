# ðŸ“‹ Canyon Ranch DB Project - Workflow Tracker

This document outlines all tasks from Milestone 1 to Milestone 3, broken into small chunks with checkboxes to track progress easily. Updated to reflect use of GPT for data generation.

- [x] Documented risks and expected benefits
- [x] Format and write up the report section

### ðŸ”¹ ER Diagram
- [x] Identified all necessary entities and attributes
- [x] Defined relationships, constraints, cardinalities
- [x] Created ER diagram using ERDPlus
- [x] Finalized and exported as `er_diagram.png`
- [x] Submitted milestone 1 report (`milestone1_report.docx`)

## ðŸš§ Milestone 2: Logical + Physical Design

### ðŸ”¹ Logical Design (Relational Schema)
- [x] Converted ER diagram to relational schema in `schema.sql`
- [x] Created `relational_schema.png` from ERDPlus
- [x] Documented functional dependencies in `functional_dependencies.md`
- [x] Ensured all relations are normalized to 3NF

### ðŸ”¹ Physical Design (SQL Server)
- [x] Create schema in SQL Server (`CanyonRanch`)
- [x] Implement all tables in `create_tables.sql`
- [x] Add PKs, FKs, NOT NULLs, CHECKs

### ðŸ”¹ Sample Data (AI-Powered)
- [x] Use GPT to generate `INSERT INTO` statements per table
- [x] Maintain referential integrity across inserts
- [x] Validate FKs using test queries (`test_queries.sql`)

### ðŸ”¹ Backup
- [ ] Create `.bak` file and save to `backup/`

### ðŸ”¹ Documentation
- [ ] Compile `milestone2_report.docx` with:
  - Schema
  - Functional dependencies
  - Normalization logic
  - Sample data
  - Screenshots

## ðŸ“ˆ Milestone 3: Data Warehouse + Final Deliverables

### ðŸ”¹ Dimensional Model
- [ ] Identify one fact table (e.g., Reservation_Service)

### ðŸ”¹ DW Implementation
- [ ] Create DW tables in SQL Server (e.g., in schema `CanyonDW`)
- [ ] Add appropriate keys and naming

### ðŸ”¹ Extra Credit (Optional)
- [ ] Use `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` to populate DW tables from base DB

### ðŸ”¹ Privacy & Ethics
